# The-Simon-Game
This is a game website to brush up your memory skills, which you can play anytime and from anywhere . This website is made using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript. 

Simon is a game of memory skill. The website creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. 

Gameplay:
The game has four coloured buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed. A round in the game consists of the homepage lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
